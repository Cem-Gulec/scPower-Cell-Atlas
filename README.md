## Project Purpose
To develop an online resource for optimal experimental design and power analysis of cell type specific multisample comparisons and CRISPR screening single cell transcriptomics experiments.

## Abstract
Single cell RNA-seq has revolutionized transcriptomics by providing cell type resolution for differential gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses. The applicant has developed scPower, an efficient power analysis method for single cell data and inter-individual comparisons. It enables researchers to identify the most powerful experimental design for a given budget. The model relies on cell type specific prior data. To unlock the full
potential of this method for the wider research community, here it is proposed to systematically apply it to organism scale reference cell atlases available through the HCA. Based on these systematic priors, a unified experimental design online resource will be established. It will enable researchers to design the most powerful experiments for the identification of differential expression or eQTL in their respective application areas. The model will further be extended to
allow for the optimal design of allele specific expression and perturbation experiments such as CROP-seq and Perturb-seq.
